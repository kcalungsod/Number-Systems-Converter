# Number-Systems-Converter
This project is a C# windows form application that would allow the user to convert a number system to any other number system. The number system that this program can handle includes: (1) Binary, (2) Octal, (3) Decimal and(4) Hexadecimal.

This system has a total of five (5) forms – one for each number system – and a main form that would act as a homepage of the program.  

In my code, I have included a proper error handling setup. Any inputs that would not follow the instructions would be given a warning message – with the improper input automatically cleared so that a new input can be placed.

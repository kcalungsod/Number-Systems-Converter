# Number-Systems-Converter
This project is a C# windows form application that would allow the user to convert a number system to any other number system. The number system that this program can handle includes: Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal.

This system has a total of five (5) forms – one for each number system – and a main form that would act as a homepage of the program.  

In my code, I have included a proper error handling setup. Any inputs that would not follow the instructions would be given a warning message – with the improper input automatically cleared so that a new input can be placed.

Do note that I have tried to create my own working algorithm on this based on my understanding of the topic and have refrained from copying from sources available online. Therefore, there may be bugs that I have overlooked or haven't solved whilst creating this.
